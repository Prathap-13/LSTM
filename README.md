#-----------------------------Analysis of the Energy Consumption Forecasting Problem in Smart Buildings Using LSTM----------------------------------------------------------#

The project titled ”Analysis of the Energy Consumption Forecasting Problem in Smart
Buildings Using LSTM” focuses on utilizing sophisticated machine learning methods to
predict energy consumption patterns in smart buildings. The primary objective is to develop
a robust forecasting model using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of
recurrent neural network (RNN) well-suited for time series prediction tasks. By accurately
predicting energy usage, the project aims to enhance energy management systems, reduce
operational costs, and promote sustainability in smart buildings. This approach addresses
the increasing demand for efficient energy and the integration of intelligent systems in
modern infrastructure.
In the initial phase, the project involves collecting and preprocessing data related to
energy consumption, such as timestamps and consumption levels. Feature extraction techniques are applied to convert raw data into valuable insights inputs for the LSTM model.
The data is then resampled and scaled to ensure consistency and improve model performance. The prepared dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to facilitate
model training and evaluation. By structuring the data appropriately, the project ensures
the LSTM model can learn and generalize effectively, leading to accurate energy consumption forecasts.
The project focuses on implementing an LSTM-based forecasting the model that identifies patterns over time in energy consumption data. After training the model involves
teaching it to make predictions based on historical data, its accuracy assessed using metrics
such as mean squared error (MSE). Additionally, the project includes a graphical user interface (GUI) for user interaction. This GUI allows users to upload CSV files, visualize data,
and view forecasting results. This comprehensive approach highlights the technical capabilities of LSTM networks in energy forecasting and offers a practical tool for managing
and optimizing energy usage in smart buildings.
